# TomorrowDAO-contracts

The TomorrowDAO Contract is a new and cool smart contract wallet in aelf ecosystem that provides a familiar Web2 experience for controlling your Web3 identities and assets. It allows users to protect their identities and assets with guardians they trust. TomorrowDAO enables the management of devices/guardians at risk so that the owners keep control over their possessions. It also synchronizes users' identities through all aelf's chains. The contract is built on the aelf blockchain, a high-performance blockchain platform that uses a unique consensus algorithm called the aelf's Delegated Proof of Stake (AEDPoS).

## Installation

Before cloning the code and deploying the contract, command dependencies and development tools are needed. You can follow:

- [Common dependencies](https://aelf-boilerplate-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/dependencies.html)
- [Building sources and development tools](https://aelf-boilerplate-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/tools.html)

The following command will clone TomorrowDAO Contract into a folder. Please open a terminal and enter the following command:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/TomorrowDAOProject/tomorrowDAO-contracts
```

## Usage

The TomorrowDAO Contract provides the following modules:

- `dao`: Create and manage your dao.
- `governance`: Manage the proposal of dao.
- `treasury`: Manage the treasury of dao.
